# week02-project

Build an accessable image gallery

enjoyed the problem solving on this one

first 2 hours- nothing working, missed a letter b from thumnail near the top of the page, sense of achievment when error was corrected and everything suddenly worked

later the 800px thumnbnail bar wasn't acting according to flex, next day check the code and the dev tools to find the left attribute wasn't altering when the media queries took effect added an auto left to fix the problem.

took a break for half a day

the researching of getting the buttons working was fun and a headache, taking cordelia's advice and asking chatGPT for some pointers worked, i was close " addFullSizeImage(images[currentIndex])" <<< from chatGPT, i was using fullSizeImage.src=(images[currentindex]).src from what i saw in Tims video

finally sunday lunchtime everything came together nicely and am quite pleased with the result, i added that if you change the size of the viewport from top to bottom by using vh as the size modifiers the objects inside shrink too, trying to mimic a lower resolution or the use of a mobile device
